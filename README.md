# K-Means Spotify Songs Clustering
This project involves clustering a dataset of Spotify songs using the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to group songs with similar features, allowing for the exploration of patterns and relationships in the data.

## Introduction
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). In this project, we use K-Means to cluster Spotify songs based on various audio features provided in the dataset.

## Dataset
Dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs)
The dataset contains various audio features of Spotify songs, such as:
- Danceability
- Energy
- Speechiness
- Acousticness
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Valence

These features help in understanding the characteristics of each song and grouping similar songs together.
